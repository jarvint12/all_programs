# all_programs
This repository contains my recent school projects, as well as some work done at the University of Helsinki. University of Helsinki contains my bachelor's thesis, file arrangement program and some other work I have done there. My largest program is bachelor's thesis mutation load tool, while the most interesting one can be found from AI in health tech: neural network, which identifies abnormal images from normal. Statistical R-programming can be found from Multivariate Statistican Analysis, while Machine Learning: Advanced Probabilistic Methods contains theory about machine learning. Statistical Natural Language Processing contains course exercise sessions from the course, where I made for example program, which can identify songs to certain artists. C programming, C plus programming and applied maths computer works are some older courses. However, my most advanced Matlab and Mathematica programming can be found from applied maths folder.
