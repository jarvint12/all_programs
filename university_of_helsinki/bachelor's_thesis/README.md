The main program of my bachelor's thesis can be found from mutation_load_tool and is named mutation_load3.py. It takes bam and VCF files as an input, counts read depths for genomic positions from bam file and creates CDF plots for the read depths of different samples. In addition, it permutates same amount of same type of mutations as in VCF file, which can be used to create a null distribution, which is used in for example convert_vcf_to_test_programs folder. After the results, plot_ranks folder creates plots for different gene ranks given by the test programs.
