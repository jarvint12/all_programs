    "# Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "**Part-of-speech tagging** (**POS tagging**) is the process of annotating words in an input sequence with their corresponding part-of-speech labels. Word's **part-of-speech** gives us more information about the word itself and about its neighboring words (nouns are preceded by determiners \"a dog\" and adjectives \"nice dog\"). For instance, we can use POS tags as features for the Named Entitity Recognition task: Proper Nouns like names are usually these entities. Moreover, a word's **part-of-speech** provides us with an understanding of how to pronounce this word: cOntent if it is a noun and contEnt if it is an adjective. This helps in such tasks as speech synthesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment we're going to create two systems for assigning POS tags. They are both based on statistics collected from a corpus annotated with POS tags by humans. First, we will be assigning words the most frequent tag it has been seen with. This is a **baseline** we will be trying to beat. Second, we will create a **Hidden Markov Model** **HMM** system and compare its performance to our baseline. The POS tagging algorithm is judged by how **accurate** it is. So we are going to use **accuracy** as the performance metric.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this assignment we will be using [the GUM corpus](https://corpling.uis.georgetown.edu/gum/) annotated with [Universal Dependencies POS tags](https://universaldependencies.org/u/pos/). We recomend to study the tags, to understand what each of them means.\n",

    "The accuracy score of your baseline model should be around 85 percent. But it doesn't tell us much about what's going wrong.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will create a confusion matrix to look deeper into the results. A confusion matrix tells us how many times each true tag was predicted as itself and as some other tag. The rows of the matrix are correct labels, the columns are all tags it could have been confused with. The cell tells how many times a true tag was predicted as some column tag.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, we have the following sequences of tags:\n",
    "* `y_true = ['PRON', 'ADJ', 'ADJ', 'NOUN']`\n",
    "* `y_predicted = ['NOUN', 'ADJ', 'NOUN', 'NOUN']`\n",
    "\n",
    "The sequence of tags that labels rows and columns is `['ADJ', 'NOUN', 'PRON']`, then our confusion matrix will look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "` \n",
    "1 1 0 \n",
    "0 1 0 \n",
    "0 1 0\n",
    "`\n",
    "\n",
    "* The element `[0][0] = 1` tells us that `'ADJ'` was correctly predicted as itself once.\n",
    "* The element `[0][1] = 1` tells us that `'ADJ'` was confused with `'NOUN'` once.\n",
    "* The element `[1][1] = 1` tells us that `'NOUN'` was correctly predicted as itself once.\n",
    "* The element `[2][1] = 1` tells us that `'PRON'` was confused with `'NOUN'` once.\n",
    "\n",
    "But let's be honest, raw counts are hard to compare and plot. We will need to normalize our matrix: to make a number of predictions of every tag sum to 1. This will help us visually compare mistakes made for both frequent and infrequent tags. After normalization, the true labels in our confusion matrix are rows, the cells in these rows correspond to the fraction of times this tag was predicted as a tag that marks the column. So, for our example it will look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "`\n",
    "0.5 0.5 0\n",
    " 0   1  0\n",
    " 0   1  0\n",
    "`\n",
    "* The element `[0][0] = 0.5` tells us that `'ADJ'` was correctly predicted as itself only half of the time.\n",
    "* The element `[0][1] = 0.5` tells us that `'ADJ'` was confused with `'NOUN'` half of the time.\n",
    "* The element `[1][1] = 1` tells us that `'NOUN'` was correctly predicted as itself all the time.\n",
    "* The element `[2][1] = 1` tells us that `'PRON'` was confused with `'NOUN'` all the time.\n",

    "Accuracy with HMM model was 90.12, while with baseline model it was 84.71. HMM model predicted almost every tag better than the baseline model, only exceptions were coordinating conjunction, particle and punctuation, which were just a little bit better with the baseline model. This can be due to pure luck. HMM model took previous tags into account, while baseline model only looked at which tag word is mostly labeled to. Thus, if open was for example usually a verb, is is labeled as a verb everytime. With HMM model, if previous word was for example adjective, it could be more probable that the next word would be an adjective instead of verb, so open could be labeled as an adjective.\n",
